# Linked Lists - Length & Count

# Implement Length() to count the number of nodes in a linked list.

# length(null) => 0
# length(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null) => 3
# Implement Count() to count the occurrences of an integer in a linked list.

# count(null, 1) => 0
# count(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> null, 1) => 1
# count(1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> null, 2) => 4
# I've decided to bundle these two functions within the same Kata since they are 
# both very similar.

# The push()/Push() and buildOneTwoThree()/BuildOneTwoThree() functions do not 
# need to be redefined.
